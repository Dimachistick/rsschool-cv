From an early age he was involved in gymnastics and acrobatics. Reached the title of Master of Sports in acrobatics. I got a job at the Ministry of Emergency Situations. At the moment I am serving and in 10 years I have reached the rank of ensign. I decided not to stop there and try in other areas of activity. Gained experience in digital marketing. Not long ago I started studying front-end. I taught myself using videos from the Internet. I was interested in the large scale of this direction. I decided to focus all my free time and energy on getting to know the IT industry.
